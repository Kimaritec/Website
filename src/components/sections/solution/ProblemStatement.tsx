      <strong>Cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide</strong>, with nearly 10 million deaths recorded in 2020
      (WHO). Cancer is in fact many different diseases, all characterised by uncontrolled proliferation of cells with
      eventual spread, or metastasis, to other parts of the body. Although chemotherapies including new targeted
      therapies are improving patient outcomes, <strong>resistance
      to therapies is inevitable</strong> and patients will die from their disease. In 2017, the 70th World Health
      Assembly stated that cancer is a significant public health concern with an urgent need for further action,
      including investment in innovative treatments.
