      <strong className="branded">Kimaritec</strong> has developed a <strong>novel platform technology</strong> to identify small molecules that block specific SUMOylation events on target proteins. <strong>SUMOylation</strong> is a post-translational modification that increases the stability of some target proteins, helps others form new interactions and moves additional target proteins into different parts of the cancer cell. <strong>SUMOylation</strong> is increased in stressed <strong>cancer cells</strong> and consequently, many cancer proteins are SUMOylated when they should not normally be. We have found that preventing SUMOylation results in targeted protein degradation â€“ this is a <strong>paradigm shift for targeted protein degradation</strong>.
