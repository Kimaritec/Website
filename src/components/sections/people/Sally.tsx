        Sally has had two forays into commercial research – firstly through a company called BenEphex Biotechnologies (2002-2015), developing anti-cancer antibodies targeting the EphB4 receptor tyrosine kinase and more recently as co-founder of Kimaritec Pty Ltd, a start-up biotechnology company focused on small molecule drug discovery for cancer treatment.

        Her personal research goal is to find new ways to treat cancer. Melanoma is in her family and she has already had 4 melanomas removed. Thankfully they were all relatively early stage but who knows – she is pretty much covered in melanocytic nevi any one of which could be the ticking timebomb.
