      <h3>Disease landscape</h3>
      <p>We are focussing on oncology targets to provide proof-of-concept. We can target aggressive cancers with un-met medical need.</p>
      <p>SUMOylation of various proteins has been reported in other diseases including neurological, metabolic and inflammatory.</p>

      <p>Resistance to current oncology drugs invariably develops and without further treatment options, patients will die from their disease.</p>
